### *Preliminary*
# ArcticFox
*[NFE Team](http://nfeteam.org) presents custom Firmware for Joyetech, Wismec and Eleaf battery mods*

```
```

**Use [NFE Toolbox](https://github.com/TBXin/NFirmwareEditor/releases) for [installing](https://github.com/maelstrom2001/ArcticFox/wiki/How-to-install) firmware and set up your device.**

## List of supported devices:

**Co-branding:** VaporFlask Lite, VaporFlask Stout, VaporFlask Classic, Beyond Vape Centurion, La Petite Box, Vaporshark Switchbox


## Limitations
The safe use of our software one of our main goals. We retain all factory restrictions, because the device manufacturer is not just for fun made them.
What we call limitations?
* Minimal Resistance (For all supported devices)
  * 0.05 Ohm for Temperature Control mode
  * 0.1 Ohm for Vari-Watt mode
* Output Wattage (Depending on the device)
* Maximum Charging Current (Depending on the device)
* Maximum Output Current (Depending on the device)
* Output Voltage Range (Depending on the device)

"Depending on the device" means that each device has own values, which are choosen by the manufacturer. The exact values you can find on the product page on the manufacturer's website.

**All requests to change these values will be rejected as we don't want you to hurt yourself or your device.**


## Profiles
The main difference is the profile based user interface, so to say, the DNA-style, and the larger focus on customization than original Joyetech firmware.
Profile is the set of parameters of used atomizer, such as coil material, resistance, power and temperature values.
The user have 8 profiles which can be edited with NFE Toolbox, and which can be assigned to his favourite atomizers.

Profiles can be switched automatically, based on saved coil resistance, and in manual mode. All you need to use the automatic switch is to enable "Smart" mode, install atomizer and assign them to the desired profile.

When you re-install this atomizer later, assigned profile will be activated automatically.
If resistance of installed atomizer is not found in profiles, you'll be prompted to select new profile or re-assign existing.

When you switching manually to profile that have saved resistance mismatch, you'll be prompted to update or keep settings of selected profile.

## Main Screen

Editing the main screen differs from original Joyetech firmwares. To edit items on main screen, call action "Edit Main" (4 Fire button clicks by default). Single Fire button click will switch next available editable item. Edit selected item by pressing regulatory buttons. To exit edit mode hold Fire button for about 1 sec.


## Main Menu

Hold Fire and Plus buttons (by default) for a 1 second to enter menu.

### Profile Menu

* **Wire** - coil material, temperature sensing or not (VW), can be set to standard or user-defined TFR;
* **Coil** - saved coil resistance;
* **TCR** - value can be edited when selected Joyetech TC algo with custom TCR;
* **T. Dom** - temperature-dominant regulation style;
* **Preheat** - power control, use preheat or power curve;
* **PI-Reg** - PI Regulator for TC mode, improves power and temperature stabilization:
     - PI-Reg On/Off - switch between stock Joyetech and PI regulation;
     - Range - 0..100% - temperature range when PI regulation becomes active. 0 means that regulator is always on and controls power distribution from start of puff, 20% for example - PI regulator turns on when temperature of coil reached 20% range from profile settings;
     - P - proportional constant, the larger it is, the sharper the power changed;
     - I - integral constant, the larger it is, the settled power distribution is smoother.
